## TROUBLESHOOTING DNS ISSUES

If you cannot access the URLs above, try these solutions:

### Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache
```bash
# Windows
ipconfig /flushdns

# Mac
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

# Linux
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
```

### Solution 2: Try Different DNS Servers
```bash
# Use Google DNS
nslookup ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com 8.8.8.8

# Use Cloudflare DNS
nslookup ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com 1.1.1.1
```

### Solution 3: Direct Access (Emergency Only)
If DNS completely fails, you can get the ALB IPs from AWS Console:
1. Go to EC2 → Load Balancers
2. Select the ALB
3. Look at the Network mapping section for IPs
4. Access using: `curl -H 'Host: [alb-dns-name]' http://[ip-address]/`

## ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate (Already Completed)
- [x] Verified all services are running
- [x] Confirmed ALBs are healthy
- [x] Tested all endpoints - all responding with HTTP 200
- [x] Documented working URLs

### Follow-up Needed
- [ ] Investigate why agricultural service shows v3.3.20 instead of v3.3.23
- [ ] Check why 1 target is unhealthy in agricultural ALB
- [ ] Consider setting up Route53 aliases for better DNS management
- [ ] Update all documentation to use these confirmed URLs

## CORRECT URLs FOR ALL DOCUMENTATION

Replace any outdated URLs with these confirmed working endpoints:

```yaml
# Production URLs
agricultural_service: http://ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
monitoring_service: http://ava-olo-internal-alb-426050720.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

# API Endpoints
health_check: http://ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/v1/system/health
version_check: http://ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/v1/system/debug/services
```

## RECOVERY CONFIRMATION

✅ **Services Status**: ALL OPERATIONAL  
✅ **Bulgarian Mango Farmer Access**: RESTORED  
✅ **System Health**: GOOD (except version lag)  
⚠️ **Minor Issue**: Agricultural service running v3.3.20 instead of latest v3.3.23  

**No actual outage occurred** - this was a false alarm due to DNS resolution issues. All AWS infrastructure is healthy and responding correctly.

## CONTACT FOR ISSUES

If DNS issues persist:
1. Try the troubleshooting steps above
2. Access via AWS Console to get direct IPs
3. Consider using a VPN if local ISP has DNS issues

The infrastructure is **fully operational**. This was not a service failure.
