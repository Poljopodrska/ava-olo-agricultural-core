## [2025-07-20] Dual ALB Architecture Implementation - Development Phase

### Infrastructure Changes
**Feature**: Implemented dual Application Load Balancer architecture to separate customer-facing and internal services

**New Load Balancers Created**:
1. **ava-olo-farmers-alb** (Customer-facing)
   - DNS: ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
   - ARN: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:127679825789:loadbalancer/app/ava-olo-farmers-alb/d75e5cd812623076
   - Target Group: ava-farmers-tg
   - Service: Agricultural Core
   - Status: ✅ ACTIVE

2. **ava-olo-internal-alb** (Internal monitoring)
   - DNS: ava-olo-internal-alb-426050720.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
   - ARN: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:127679825789:loadbalancer/app/ava-olo-internal-alb/8502422e0389f692
   - Target Group: ava-monitoring-internal-tg
   - Service: Monitoring Dashboards
   - Status: ✅ ACTIVE

**Security Configuration**:
- Created development security group (sg-049c14ab3436e6dc5) with HTTP access from 0.0.0.0/0
- Updated ECS task security group to allow traffic from new ALBs
- Both ALBs currently publicly accessible (development phase)

**ECS Service Updates**:
- Agricultural Core service updated to use ava-farmers-tg
- Monitoring Dashboards service updated to use ava-monitoring-internal-tg
- Both services successfully migrated and health checks passing

**TODO Before Production**:
- [ ] Add IP restrictions to internal ALB
- [ ] Enable SSL certificates on both ALBs  
- [ ] Add AWS WAF to farmers ALB
- [ ] Update to HTTPS only
- [ ] Decommission old shared ALB (ava-olo-alb)

**Testing Results**:
- Farmers ALB health endpoint: ✅ Working
- Internal ALB health endpoint: ✅ Working
- Both services accessible on new ALBs

### Business Impact
- Architectural separation achieved between customer and internal services
- Ready for security hardening when moving to production
- No downtime during migration
- Bulgarian mango farmer can access farmers ALB, internal team can access dashboards ALB
