# 🏛️ Constitutional Amendment #15: Deployment Verification Rule

## 📋 **Supreme Deployment Law**
**"No feature shall be considered complete until verified operational in AWS production"**

### 🚨 **Mandatory Verification Protocol**
Every deployment MUST include:

1. **Pre-Deployment**: Constitutional compliance check
2. **Deployment**: Standard AWS deployment process  
3. **Post-Deployment**: MANDATORY production verification
4. **Completion**: Only report success after AWS verification

### 📊 **Verification Requirements**
- [ ] Direct HTTP test of deployed features
- [ ] Feature functionality confirmation on live AWS URLs
- [ ] User interface elements visible and functional
- [ ] Database operations working in production
- [ ] Constitutional compliance maintained in production

### ⚖️ **Constitutional Violation**
Reporting deployment success without AWS production verification is a **CRITICAL CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION**.

### 🔧 **Implementation**
All deployment scripts must include:
```bash
# Mandatory production verification
curl -f $AWS_URL/feature-endpoint || exit 1
python verify_production_features.py || exit 1
```

**Effective Immediately**: All future deployments must follow this protocol.
