# Version Fix Summary - v3.3.24 Unicorn Test

**Date**: 2025-07-22 03:15 CET  
**Status**: âœ… FIXED - Service now showing v3.3.24-unicorn-test-ðŸ¦„

## Problem
- Code showed v3.3.23 in config.py
- Production showed v3.3.20
- ECS was stuck with old deployment

## Root Cause
1. **Task Definition 7 Failed**: Required AWS Secrets Manager secret that didn't exist
   - Error: `ResourceNotFoundException: Secrets Manager can't find the specified secret`
   - Secret ARN: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:127679825789:secret:ava-olo/admin`
2. **ECS Couldn't Start New Tasks**: All new tasks failed immediately
3. **Service Fell Back**: Kept using old task definition 5 with v3.3.20

## Solution Applied
1. **Reverted to Task Definition 5**: Working definition without secrets
2. **Added Unicorn Test**: Unmistakable visual verification
3. **Deployment Succeeded**: Now showing v3.3.24

## Verification
Visit: http://ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

You will see:
- ðŸ¦„ Pink background
- Giant unicorn image
- "UNICORN TEST v3.3.24" text
- Deployment timestamp

## API Verification
```bash
curl http://ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/version
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "version": "v3.3.24-unicorn-test-ðŸ¦„",
  "unicorn_test": "ðŸ¦„ YES - DEPLOYMENT WORKED! ðŸ¦„",
  "deployment_timestamp": "2025-07-22T01:12:43.672342",
  "big_unicorn": "ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„..." (50 unicorns)
}
```

## Permanent Fix Needed
1. Create new task definition without secret dependencies
2. Or create the missing secret in AWS Secrets Manager
3. Test deployment pipeline end-to-end

## Scripts Created
- `check_version_issue.py` - Diagnosed the problem
- `force_ecs_update_v23.py` - Attempted to force update
- `fix_ecs_secret_issue.py` - Reverted to working task definition
- `monitor_unicorn_deployment.py` - Monitored deployment

## Lesson Learned
When deployments fail silently, add obvious visual verification (like unicorns!) to make success/failure unmistakable.
