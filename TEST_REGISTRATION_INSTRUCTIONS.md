# üå± Testing AVA OLO Registration

## Current Status
The deployment was successful but CAVA routes didn't load (likely due to missing Redis/Neo4j connections). The system is using the fallback registration which seems to be having issues.

## How to Test Registration via Web Interface:

1. **Open the AVA OLO Web Interface**:
   - Go to: https://3ksdvgdtad.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/
   - You'll see the "Join AVA OLO" form

2. **Test the Registration Flow**:
   - Enter your Farmer ID (any number like 12345)
   - Type your message starting with your name: "Peter Knafliƒç"
   - Click "Send Message"
   - Follow the prompts for phone number and password

## What's Happening:
- CAVA routes are not loaded due to missing database connections
- The system is falling back to the original registration system
- The error "technical difficulties" suggests the LLM integration might be having issues

## Next Steps to Fix:

1. **Check AWS App Runner Logs**:
   - Look for error messages about CAVA initialization
   - Check if OpenAI API key is properly set

2. **Quick Fix Options**:
   - Set up Redis on AWS ElastiCache
   - Set up Neo4j on AWS Neptune or EC2
   - Or keep CAVA in dry-run mode until databases are ready

3. **Alternative Testing**:
   - The original registration system should still work
   - Try using the web interface at the root URL
   - The chat-based registration might work after fixing the LLM issues

## API Endpoints Available:
- Health Check: GET /health ‚úÖ
- Main Interface: GET / ‚úÖ
- Chat Register: POST /api/v1/auth/chat-register ‚ö†Ô∏è (having issues)
- CAVA endpoints: NOT LOADED ‚ùå

## To Enable CAVA:
1. Set up Redis (AWS ElastiCache)
2. Set up Neo4j (AWS Neptune or EC2)
3. Update apprunner.yaml with connection strings
4. Set CAVA_DRY_RUN_MODE=false
5. Redeploy

For now, the main application is working, but without the CAVA enhancements.
